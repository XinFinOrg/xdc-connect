# Xdc Connect - `Functionality`

This documentation enlists the various event listeners & interface APIs exported from `xdc-connect`

## Listeners

XDC-CONNECT allows user to listen for state changes by providing the listeners as `props`( [1](#wallet-connect-props) ).  
Currently you can listen for the following updates in your component :

1. On Wallet Connect - `onConnect`
2. On Wallet Disconnect - `onDisconnect`
3. On Address Change - `onAddressChange`

Each listener will be called with a parameter of `wallet` ( [2](#wallet-object) ) which represents the state of the connected xdc wallet post the event trigger.

### On Connect

Event is triggered when any of the loader successfully connects with application. The listener willl be called with an `wallet` ( [2](#wallet-object) ) object.

### On Disconnect

Event is triggered when any of the loader successfully disconnects with application. The listener willl be called with an `wallet` ( [2](#wallet-object) ) object.

### On Address Change

Event is triggered when any of the loader changes the default **XDC** address. The listener willl be called with an `wallet` ( [2](#wallet-object) ) object.

## APIs

1. **GetWallet** - returns promise which will resolve into `wallet` ( [2](#wallet-object) ) object.
2. **GetNativeBalance** - returns promise which will resolve into xdc balance.
3. **SendTransaction** - returns promise which will resolve into xdc3 `receipt` ( [3](#transaction-receipt-object) ) for the transaction.
4. **CallTransaction** - returns promise which will resolve into response for the transaction.
5. **Disconnect** - disconnect the app with user's wallet provider.

## Examples

### OnConnect

Fired when user successfully connects their wallet. It passed an updated instance of user's wallet.

```
import React from "react";
import { XdcConnect } from "xdc-connect";
import "./App.css";
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <XdcConnect
        btnClass="btn btn-rounded btn-success"
        btnName="Custom Text"
        onConnect={(wallet) => {
          console.log("user connected wallet", wallet);
        }}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
export default App
```

### onDisconnect

Fired when user successfully logouts/disconnects their wallet.

### onAddressChange

Fired when user changes their default address from providers like XinPay.

## APIs

The library also exposes APIs to interact with the wallet provider which are as follows:

1. **GetWallet**  
   Returns `promise` which will resolve into `wallet` ( [2](#wallet-object) ) object.

2. **GetNativeBalance**  
   Returns `promise` which will resolve into xdc ( native crypto currency ) balance.

3. **SendTransaction**  
   This function can be used to make `PAYABLE` & `NONPAYBLE` state changing transactions.  This function needs to be invoded with a standard `web3 transaction object` ( [4](#transaction-object) ).  
   Returns `promise` which will resolve into xdc3 `receipt` ( [3](#transaction-receipt-object) ) for the transaction.
   The receipt is a standard `web3 receipt object`.

4. **CallTransaction**  
   This function needs to be invoded with a standard `web3 transaction object` ( [4](#transaction-object) ).  
   Returns `promise` which will resolve into response for the transaction.  
   The response will be `hex` encoded and can de decoded by providing the type of expected response by calling the following function:
   ```
     const decoded = xdc3.eth.abi.decodeParameter("string", encodedHex); // here "string" is the type of parameter
   ```
5. **Disconnect**  
   Disconnect the app with user's wallet provider.

### Example

```

import React, { useState } from "react";
import { XdcConnect, Disconnect } from "xdc-connect";
import "./App.css";
function App() {
  const [wallet, setwallet] = useState({});
console.log("wallet", wallet);
return (
    <div className="App">
      <XdcConnect
        btnClass={
          wallet.connected
            ? "btn btn-rounded btn-success"
            : "btn btn-rounded btn-warning"
        }
        btnName={wallet.connected ? "CONNECTED" : "CONNECT"}
        onConnect={(wallet) => {
          console.log("user connected wallet", wallet);
          setwallet(wallet);
        }}
        onDisconnect={(wallet) => {
          console.log("user connected disconnect", wallet);
          setwallet(wallet);props
        }}
      />
      {wallet.connected ? <button onClick={Disconnect}>Logout</button> : ""}
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;

```

## Interfaces
